# Game Design
## First Person - Survival?

### Initial Concept Sketches
![Game Layout Sketch 1]
*Sketch Description: First-person view showing a room with:*
- Standing figure in foreground
- Circular marker/sign post
- Simple geometric room layout
- Door or passage indicators

### Silent Movement
- Movement through different sized maps
- Turn-based mechanics with triggers

### Room Layout Concepts
![Top-down Layout Sketch]
*Sketch Description: Top-down view of room layout showing:*
- Square/rectangular rooms
- Door placements
- Movement grid pattern
- Notes indicating "smaller maps loop up"
- Annotation: "Quiet time, don't escape!"
- Additional note: "Deep Sleep"

### Core Objective
"Find a way to escape this place before..."

![Character Perspective Sketch]
*Sketch Description: Side-view character sketch showing:*
- Figure in rain or atmospheric effect
- Simple geometric environment
- Directional indicators
- Note: "Flash -> camera trigger"

### Movement Rules
*From original notes:*
- "More destruction with triggers as time goes on"
- "Punishment if you talk to human with time involved"

### Map Concepts
![Room Layout Grid]
*Sketch Description: Grid-based room layout showing:*
- Square rooms connected by passages
- Door placement options
- Movement path indicators
- Note: "only 1 block death after time"
- Multiple pathway options

### Escape Mechanics
- "How to escape:"
  - Save map usage
  - Full exploration required
  - Timing system to track progress
  - "Be more generous"

### Key Features
*As written in notes:*
- "Flash" camera trigger mechanics
- "Save points every time you want to save this part"
- "If you don't take your time, it's weapon or you have died!"
- "Complex trigger system"

### Resource Management
- "Gather resources"
- "Gather info"
- "New ways unlock after studying"

### Time-Based Elements
- "Some major time only after specific time"
- "Only 1 block death after time & find wrong way"
- Look around mechanics
- Multiple endings (don't escape)

### Environment Design
Based on the sketches:
- First-person viewpoint rooms (as shown in top sketch)
- Turn-based movement grid (illustrated in map layouts)
- Interactive elements like:
  - Doors (shown in multiple sketches)
  - Standing markers (circular indicators in first-person view)
  - Environmental objects

### Map Features
From the sketched layouts:
- Square/grid-based movement (as shown in bottom sketches)
- Door placement systems
- Interactive object positions
- Multiple pathways

### Additional Notes
*Direct quotes from sketches:*
- "Must have 12 human style"
- "Different save maps"
- "Purpose: Find a way to escape this place"
- "Some major time only after specific time"

## Level Design Elements
Based on the drawings:
- Grid-based movement system (illustrated in multiple sketches)
- Door placement for navigation
- Standing points for character positioning
- Interactive elements placement
- Multiple room configurations:
  - Small confined spaces
  - Larger exploration areas
  - Strategic save point locations

### Navigation Systems
- Turn-based movement
- Grid alignment (as shown in layout sketches)
- Door interactions
- Path choices

*Note: All sketch descriptions refer to the original notebook images and maintain the hand-drawn nature of the concept art while documenting the design intentions.*

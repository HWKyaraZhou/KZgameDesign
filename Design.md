// THIS IS NOT WHAT I"M TRYING TO DO

# Game Design
## First Person - Survival?

### Initial Concept Sketches
![Game Layout Sketch 1](https://github.com/avivpilipski/KZgameDesign/blob/main/gameDesign.jpg)
*Sketch Description: First-person view showing a room with:*
- Standing figure in foreground
- Circular marker/sign post
- Simple geometric room layout
- Door or passage indicators

### Silent Movement
- Movement through different sized maps
- Turn-based mechanics with triggers

### Room Layout Concepts
*Sketch Description: Top-down view of room layout showing:*
- Square/rectangular rooms
- Door placements
- Movement grid pattern
- Notes indicating "smaller maps loop up"
- Annotation: "Quiet time, don't escape!"
- Additional note: "Deep Sleep"

### Core Objective
"Find a way to escape this place before..."
*Sketch Description: Side-view character sketch showing:*
- Figure in rain or atmospheric effect
- Simple geometric environment
- Directional indicators
- Note: "Flash -> camera trigger"

### Movement Rules
*From original notes:*
- "More destruction with triggers as time goes on"
- "Punishment if you talk to human with time involved"

### Map Concepts
*Sketch Description: Grid-based room layout showing:*
- Square rooms connected by passages
- Door placement options
- Movement path indicators
- Note: "only 1 block death after time"
- Multiple pathway options

### Escape Mechanics
- "How to escape:"
  - Save map usage
  - Full exploration required
  - Timing system to track progress
  - "Be more generous"

### Key Features
*As written in notes:*
- "Flash" camera trigger mechanics
- "Save points every time you want to save this part"
- "If you don't take your time, it's weapon or you have died!"
- "Complex trigger system"

### Resource Management
- "Gather resources"
- "Gather info"
- "New ways unlock after studying"

### Time-Based Elements
- "Some major time only after specific time"
- "Only 1 block death after time & find wrong way"
- Look around mechanics
- Multiple endings (don't escape)

### Environment Design
Based on the sketches:
- First-person viewpoint rooms (as shown in top sketch)
- Turn-based movement grid (illustrated in map layouts)
- Interactive elements like:
  - Doors (shown in multiple sketches)
  - Standing markers (circular indicators in first-person view)
  - Environmental objects

### Map Features
From the sketched layouts:
- Square/grid-based movement (as shown in bottom sketches)
- Door placement systems
- Interactive object positions
- Multiple pathways

### Additional Notes
*Direct quotes from sketches:*
- "Must have 12 human style"
- "Different save maps"
- "Purpose: Find a way to escape this place"
- "Some major time only after specific time"

## Level Design Elements
Based on the drawings:
- Grid-based movement system (illustrated in multiple sketches)
- Door placement for navigation
- Standing points for character positioning
- Interactive elements placement
- Multiple room configurations:
  - Small confined spaces
  - Larger exploration areas
  - Strategic save point locations

### Navigation Systems
- Turn-based movement
- Grid alignment (as shown in layout sketches)
- Door interactions
- Path choices

*Note: All sketch descriptions refer to the original notebook images and maintain the hand-drawn nature of the concept art while documenting the design intentions.*

## Design Analysis & Suggestions

### Potential Design Gaps

#### Core Mechanics Clarity
- The "quiet time, don't escape" mechanic needs more specific definition
  - What happens during quiet time?
  - Are there consequences for movement during these periods?
  - How is the player informed of quiet time periods?

#### Player Feedback Systems
- Current design lacks clear indication of:
  - Progress tracking
  - Resource status
  - Time remaining
  - Threat proximity
- Suggestion: Add visual/audio cues for player state

#### Save System Refinement
- "Save points every time you want to save this part" needs structure:
  - Limited save points for tension?
  - Checkpoint system instead of free saves?
  - Save point placement strategy?

#### Time Mechanics Elaboration
- Several time-based elements need connection:
  - How does "deep sleep" advance time?
  - What triggers time progression?
  - How is time communicated to player?
- Consider: Visual time indicators or environmental changes

#### Resource System Details
- Current "gather resources" concept needs:
  - Specific resource types
  - Resource management mechanics
  - Usage scenarios
  - Storage limitations
  - Resource distribution strategy

#### Player Navigation
- Grid-based movement could benefit from:
  - Clear movement rules
  - Turn cost system
  - Movement limitations
  - Environmental hazards
- Consider: Movement sound mechanics

#### Interaction Framework
- "Flash/camera trigger" system needs:
  - Purpose definition
  - Usage limitations
  - Connection to core gameplay
  - Feedback mechanisms

#### Environmental Storytelling
- Current design could expand on:
  - Why is the player there?
  - What's the escape urgency?
  - Environmental narrative elements
  - Background story integration

#### Challenge Progression
- Design would benefit from:
  - Difficulty scaling system
  - Learning curve structure
  - Skill development path
  - Challenge variety

### Suggested Additions

#### Player Systems
1. **Stress Meter**
   - Affects movement speed
   - Influences decision-making
   - Triggers environmental changes

2. **Discovery Mechanics**
   - Documentation finding
   - Environmental clues
   - Story revelation system

3. **Consequence System**
   - Failed escape attempts
   - Resource mismanagement
   - Time limitation effects

#### Environmental Elements
1. **Sound Design Framework**
   - Movement sound levels
   - Environmental audio cues
   - Threat indicators

2. **Visual Feedback System**
   - Status indicators
   - Environmental state changes
   - Interaction possibilities

3. **Time Visualization**
   - Day/night cycles
   - Time pressure indicators
   - Deadline visualization

### Technical Considerations
- How will the grid system handle:
  - Diagonal movement?
  - Multiple floor levels?
  - Object interaction range?
  - Line of sight mechanics?

### Quality of Life Features
Consider adding:
- Tutorial system
- Objective tracker
- Resource mapping
- Help system
- Accessibility options

### Risk Assessment
Current design might face challenges with:
- Player orientation in grid system
- Time mechanic clarity
- Save point frustration
- Resource scarcity balance
- Navigation confusion

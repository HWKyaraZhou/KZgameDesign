# Game Design
## First Person - Survival
# game inspirations(very helpful to see; order of influence?):
- House
- Rusty Lake series(including cube escape)
- Don't Escape series(especially 2)
- Bad Dream series

### goal
- survive and escape the map through interactions under a certain amount of time


### Initial Concept Sketches
![Game Layout Sketch 1](https://github.com/avivpilipski/KZgameDesign/blob/main/gameDesign.jpg)
*Sketch Description: First-person view showing a room with:*
- Standing figure in foreground
- Circular marker/sign post to track if the monster is behind the player

### features
- timed gameplay; game will automatically fail after a certain amount of time (easier mode = more time)
- exterior and interior map will change based on time progression
- an inventory to hold items
- conversation with npc to gather information and trigger events
- a monster will spawn randomly inside the game. 
- multiple endings
- no save system

### Exterior map layout
- a top down view map with possible locations to go
- possible locations include: home, tba, etc. 
- player starts in the home

### Interior Map Concepts
- point and click game
- flat: 2 main directions: left(turn left), right (turn right)
- occasional: up (look upward), down (look downward)
- left/right/up/down clicks change the view of the character, but not its position
- arrows in map (move front & move back)
- interactive objects

### Core Objective
"Find a way to escape this place before..."
*Sketch Description: Side-view character sketch showing:*
- leave the town 
- don't die

### Environment Design
Based on the sketches:
- First-person viewpoint rooms (as shown in top sketch)
- rather more gloomy atmosphere

*Note: All sketch descriptions refer to the original notebook images and maintain the hand-drawn nature of the concept art while documenting the design intentions.*

## Design Analysis & Suggestions

### Potential Design Gaps

#### Player Feedback Systems
- Current design lacks clear indication of:
  - Progress tracking
  - Resource status
  - Time remaining
  - Threat proximity
- Suggestion: Add visual/audio cues for player state


#### Environmental Storytelling
- Current design could expand on:
  - Why is the player there?
  - What's the escape urgency?
  - Environmental narrative elements
  - Background story integration

#### Challenge Progression
- Design would benefit from:
  - Difficulty scaling system
  - Learning curve structure
  - Skill development path
  - Challenge variety

### Suggested Additions

#### Player Systems
2. **Discovery Mechanics**
   - Documentation finding
   - Environmental clues
   - Story revelation system

3. **Consequence System**
   - Failed escape attempts
   - Resource mismanagement
   - Time limitation effects

#### Environmental Elements
1. **Sound Design Framework**
   - Movement sound levels
   - Environmental audio cues
   - Threat indicators

2. **Visual Feedback System**
   - Environmental state changes
   - Interaction possibilities

### Quality of Life Features
Consider adding:
- Objective tracker
- Resource mapping
- Help system
- Accessibility options

### Risk Assessment
Current design might face challenges with:
- Time mechanic clarity
- Save point frustration
- Resource scarcity balance
- Navigation confusion
